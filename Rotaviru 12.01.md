# what is rotavirus

## 原因 

common in children ages 3 to 35 months particularly in the child care, such as don't wash your hands after changing your child's diaper or helping your child use the toilet — the virus can spread to anything you touch, including food, toys and utensils.

 transmitted from parents to children especially the child in the child care

## 特性

Rotavirus is a very contagious virus that causes diarrhea. It's the most common cause of diarrhea in infants and children worldwide, resulting in over 215,000 deaths annually.

 Before the development of a vaccine, most children in the United States had been infected with the virus at least once by age 5.



A rotavirus infection usually starts within two days of exposure to the virus. Initial symptoms are a fever and vomiting, followed by three to eight days of watery diarrhea. The infection can cause abdominal pain as well.

## 疫苗

**RotaTeq**

**Rotarix**

这两种疫苗均被认为可以高效预防严重的胃肠道疾病

在1998年Rotashield作为世界上第一个被批准上市的轮状病毒 疫苗仅过9月即因在婴儿中出现肠套叠事件而退出市场

疫苗副作用 一部分肠子缩在另一部分里面（生命危险）

## Investigation of an Outbreak of Adult Diarrhea Rotavirus in China

https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/160/6/948/833720

Both asymptomatic infection and person-to-person spread identified in this epidemic suggest that current emphasis on preventing **waterborne transmission may not ** control the introduction of ADRV into new areas.

## First Detection of Group C Rotavirus in Fecal Specimens of Children with Diarrhea in the United States

http://www.sci-hub.ren/https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/172/1/45/853736

Diarrhea was defined as two or more loose or watery bowel movements within a 24-h period in children who had no other identifiable, noninfectious cause for their diarrhea 

 a nosocomial case was defined as the new onset of diarrhea in a child >=48h after admission

Fecal specimens that were positive for rotavirus by EM but negative for group A strains by ELISA were further examined for group C rotavirus by using a group C-specific ELISA prepared with 2 hyperimmune sera as capture and biotinylated detector antibodies

All fecal specimens were screened for group A rotavirus using an ELISA kit (Rotaclone; Cambridge BioTech, Worcester, MA). For EM, stools were diluted 1:10 in 2% ammonium acetate with 3 roM magnesium chloride (pH 7). A drop ofsuspension supernatant and a drop of2% aqueous phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.2-6.5) were placed on a 300-mesh formvarcoated copper grid for 2 min, blotted, and air-dried for 5 min. Grids were examined for virus by using an EM at x52,000.

sample 704 children A total of 176 fecal specimens

Rotavirus antigen was detected in 15.3% of patients

rotavirus is tested for the presence of rotaviruses by a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassay. 

Infants between 6 and 12 months of age were most frequently affected. 

Rotavirus infection was significantly less frequent in breast-fed than among bottle-fed babies

Watery diarrhea was present in 68.5% of children.

Detection rate was highest in the spring and lowest in summer.

 The detection rate of these three viruses was 55.1% (114 out of 207 specimens), among which adenovirus and group A and C rotaviruses were identified in 11, 101 and 1 fecal specimen,

Rotaviruses (RVs) form a genus of the family *Reoviridae* and are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans and animals ([*1*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4036792/#R1)).

Rotaviruses are classified into seven antigenically distinct groups (A to G) on the basis of a common group antigen, the inner capsid protein (VP6). **Groups A, B, and C are associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals** while groups D, E, F, and G only infect animals ([11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1234047/#r11), [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1234047/#r32), [33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1234047/#r33)). 

 group C rotavirus strains are globally distributed and are thought to be one of the emerging pathogens in humans.

Electrophoretic testing of rotavirus RNA from stool specimens showed different electrophoretic migration patterns of the genomic RNA among the pairs tested, but the genomic RNA was the same within each pair of symptomatic and asymptomatic specimens.

## A waterborne outbreak of epidemic diarrhea due to group A rotavirus in Malatya Turkey

http://abakus.inonu.edu.tr/xmlui/handle/11616/7368

 Rotavirus antigen was detected in 52.7% of the studied patients. 

RT-PCR analysis led to identification of Group A rotavirus as the causative agent of this epidemic.

This outbreak shows the high epidemic potency of rotavirus in large human populations, **including all age groups** and underlines the importance of water safety in pipeline systems.

anti-rotavirus fecal IgA (RVflgA) 

43 (86%) excretors and 18 (36%) nonexcretors had a fourfold or greater RVflgA titer rise.

Preexposure RVflgA titers were higher in not infected than symptomatic (*P* = .002), asymptomatic than symptomatic (*P* = .036), and not infected than asymptomatic children (*P* = .07).
